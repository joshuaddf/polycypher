# Table Duplication Fix

## Problem Description

The assessment table was displaying multiple instances of the same result because:

1. **Two separate components** were being rendered for each assessment
2. **Both components rendered TableRow elements** - causing duplication
3. **React keys were not unique** - leading to rendering issues

## Root Cause

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Both components were rendered for each assessment
transformedAssessments.map((assessment, index) => (
  <React.Fragment key={assessment.id}>
    <AssessmentPopover assessment={assessment} index={index} />
    <AssessmentDrawer assessment={assessment} index={index} />
  </React.Fragment>
))
```

**Issues:**
- `AssessmentPopover` rendered a `TableRow` for desktop
- `AssessmentDrawer` rendered a `TableRow` for mobile  
- Both were visible simultaneously, causing duplicate rows
- Keys were based on `index` instead of unique `assessment.id`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Created Unified Component**
Replaced separate `AssessmentPopover` and `AssessmentDrawer` with a single `AssessmentTableRow` component that handles both desktop and mobile views.

### 2. **Conditional Rendering**
```typescript
// Desktop: Popover (hidden on mobile)
<TableRow className="hidden md:table-row">
  {/* Desktop content */}
</TableRow>

// Mobile: Drawer (hidden on desktop)  
<TableRow className="md:hidden">
  {/* Mobile content */}
</TableRow>
```

### 3. **Unique Keys**
```typescript
// Before: index-based keys (could cause issues)
<Popover key={`popover-${index}`}>
<Drawer key={`drawer-${index}`}>

// After: unique assessment ID keys
<Popover key={`popover-${assessment.id}`}>
<Drawer key={`drawer-${assessment.id}`}>
```

### 4. **Simplified Table Structure**
```typescript
// Before: Multiple components per assessment
transformedAssessments.map((assessment, index) => (
  <React.Fragment key={assessment.id}>
    <AssessmentPopover assessment={assessment} index={index} />
    <AssessmentDrawer assessment={assessment} index={index} />
  </React.Fragment>
))

// After: Single component per assessment
transformedAssessments.map((assessment, index) => (
  <AssessmentTableRow key={assessment.id} assessment={assessment} index={index} />
))
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ **Created** `src/app/(dashboard)/components/AssessmentTableRow.tsx` - New unified component
- ✅ **Updated** `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/clinical-portal/page.tsx` - Uses new component
- ✅ **Removed** duplicate component rendering

## How It Works Now

1. **Single component per assessment** - No more duplication
2. **Responsive design** - Desktop shows popover, mobile shows drawer
3. **Unique keys** - Each assessment has a unique React key
4. **Clean table structure** - One row per assessment

## Benefits

- ✅ **No more duplicate rows** - Each assessment appears once
- ✅ **Better performance** - Fewer components to render
- ✅ **Cleaner code** - Single responsibility component
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Works on all screen sizes
- ✅ **Unique keys** - Prevents React rendering issues

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Go to Clinical Portal (`/dashboard/clinical-portal`)
2. Check the assessment table
3. Verify each assessment appears only once
4. Test on both desktop and mobile
5. Ensure popover works on desktop, drawer works on mobile

## Future Considerations

- Consider using a single table row with conditional content instead of two separate rows
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Add sorting and filtering capabilities
- Consider using a data table library for more complex functionality
