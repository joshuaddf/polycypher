    "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a set of symptoms caused by a problem with a woman’s hormones. It affects the ovaries. These are the small organs that store a woman’s eggs. But it can also affect the rest of the body. PCOS is a very common condition in women of childbearing age. In some cases, it can lead to serious health issues if not treated.",
    " Ovulation happens when a mature egg is released from an ovary. This happens so it can be fertilized by a male sperm. If the egg is not fertilized, it is sent out of the body during your period.",
    "In some cases, a woman doesn’t make enough of the hormones needed to ovulate. When ovulation doesn’t happen, the ovaries can develop many small fluid-filled sacs (cysts). These cysts make hormones called androgens. Androgens are a type of hormone normally found in abundance in men, but women normally have them in smaller amounts. Women with PCOS often have high levels of androgens. This can cause more problems with a woman’s menstrual cycle. And it can cause many of the symptoms of PCOS.",
    "Treatment for PCOS is often done with medicine. This can’t cure PCOS, but it helps reduce symptoms and prevent some health problems.",
  ],
  cause: [
    "Experts don't know the exact cause of PCOS. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance. This means the body can't use insulin well. Insulin levels build up in the body and may cause higher androgen levels. Obesity can also increase insulin levels and make PCOS symptoms worse."
  ],
  symptoms: [
    "Missed periods, irregular periods, or very light periods.",
    "Ovaries that are large or have many cysts.",
    "Extra body hair, including the chest, stomach, and back (hirsutism).",
    "Weight gain, especially around the belly.",
    "Acne or oily skin.",
    "Male-pattern baldness or thinning hair.",
    "Infertility or low fertility.",
    "Small pieces of extra skin on the neck or armpits (skin tags).",
    " Dark or thick skin patches on the back of the neck, in the armpits, and under the breasts."
  ],
  diagnosis: "PCOS is diagnosed through a combination of symptoms, physical exams, and tests. Doctors often look for at least two of these: irregular periods, high androgen levels (via blood tests), or polycystic ovaries (via ultrasound). Other conditions may be ruled out first.",
  treatment: "Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Options include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications such as birth control pills or metformin, and fertility treatments if needed. Consult a healthcare provider for a tailored plan.",
  livingWithPcos: "Managing PCOS is possible with the right strategies. Focus on a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and stress reduction. Connecting with support groups or healthcare professionals can also improve your quality of life.",
